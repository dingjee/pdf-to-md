Had Gamal Abd al-Nasir, the President of Egypt and the hero of Arab nationalism, reneged on the principles of the Arab nationalist creed when in 1963 he declared that it was Arab solidarity which constituted the .rm basis upon which Arab na­tionalism could be built,1 and that Arab solidarity would make the Arab states stronger through their cooperation in the eco­nomic, military and cultural .elds, and in the sphere of foreign policy?2 The nationalist generation must have hoped and prayed that Nasir would reconsider, come to his senses, and retread the path of revolutionary Arab nationalism with its unequivocal com­mitment to organic Arab unity.",

        "text": "But their heros intent was different, more complex, and more subtle. Nasir, after all, was both an ideologue and a politician. To him the path to Arab unity was fraught with both opportunities and constraints, and an organic unity of all the Arabs in one uni­.ed state would be the ultimate aim of a long and dialectical pro­cess consisting of several stages.3 Arab solidarity constituted one of these stages; it was a step toward unity.4 Solidarity was a pragmatic course of action when political constraints made im­practical the aggressive pursuit of comprehensive Arab unity. But even when bending to political realities, the Egyptian president would reiterate the belief, shared by all Arab nationalists, that without the goal (or at a minimum, the aspiration) of Arab political unity, Arab nationalism would be a creed without a purpose, in­deed without a meaning.5",
        "azure_translation": "但他们的英雄意图不同，更复杂，更微妙。毕竟，纳西尔既是理论家又是政治家。对他来说，通往阿拉伯统一的道路既充满了机遇，也充满了限制，所有阿拉伯人在一个统一国家中的有机统一将是一个由几个阶段组成的漫长而辩证的过程的最终目标。3 阿拉伯的团结是这些阶段之一;这是迈向团结的一步。4 当政治限制使积极追求阿拉伯全面团结变得不切实际时，团结是一种务实的行动方针。但即使屈服于政治现实，埃及总统也会重申所有阿拉伯民族主义者的共同信念，即如果没有阿拉伯政治团结的目标（或至少是愿望），阿拉伯民族主义将是一种没有目的的信条，实际上没有意义。"

His answer is unequivo­cal: The Arabs lost the war precisely because they were seven states.8 The conclusion is unambiguous: To avoid losing future wars, the Arabs had to unite into one Arab state.",

And how was this to be accomplished? A.aqs remedy was clear: by uniting these arti.cial and counterfeit countries and statelets into one Arab nation-state.

In short, to the thinkers and activists who made up the nationalist generation, Arab nationalism would be a hollow and meaningless concept if it did not strive to gather its children under one roof in one uni.ed and sovereign Arab state.

Well, not neces­sarily. In fact, an ongoing debate among specialists on Arab and Middle Eastern politics over the nature of nationalism has centered on whether achieving or desiring statehood was by necessity a core element of nationalism. Hence, the argument has predicated on whether the concept of nationalism is one of culture or one of poli­ tics. A spirited and instructive dialogue on the subject occurred on the pages of the International Journal of Middle East Studies.In their book, Rede.ning the Egyptian Nation, 19301945,13 Israel Gershoni and James Jankowski argue that the Egyptians senti­ments of af.liation and loyalty which had centered on Egypt alone were gradually shifted in the 1930s and 1940s to Arab and Islamic referents,14 a claim that was vigorously contested by Charles D.

Adrian Hastings identi.es the crucial ele­ments that transform a culturally bonded ethnic group into a na­tion as its claim to political identity and autonomy, together with the control of speci.c territory24 [italics added]. In this de.nition Hastings echoes the emphasis on a nations desire for political sepa­rateness voiced a century earlier by John Stuart Mill: Where the sentiment of a nationality exists in any force, there is a prima facie case for uniting all members of the nationality under the same gov­ernment, and a government to themselves apart.25 He then tell­ingly adds that the the strongest of all identity is that of political antecedents.26 Max Weber concurs: If one believes that it is at all expedient to distinguish national sentiment as something homo­geneous and speci.cally set apart, one can do so only by referring to a tendency toward an autonomous state. [Hence] a nation is a community of sentiment which would adequately manifest itself in a state of its own.27 In other words, what distinguishes a nation from an ethnic group or any other collectivity has to be the nations self-derived desire to achieve political sovereignty within a recog­ nized territory. Lacking such a desire, a group can be a number of things but not a nation. That is precisely why Canada is, and the old Yugoslavia was, a multinational society, since signi.cant ethnic groups within these two countries agitated for political indepen­dence, hence constituting nations. The United States, on the other hand, with its profusion of culturally based ethnicities, is not a multinational society, but rather a multiethnic society, since none of its ethnic groups desires political separation and sovereignty.",

The present author himself, in a book published in 1976, follows the practice of other analysts of the Middle East by ascribing to Arabism properties best af.xed to Arab nationalism then declaring the two terms interchange­able.28 Shibley Telhami concludes an excellent study, subtitled The New Arabism, by trying to differentiate this new phenomenon from Nasirs Arabism of the 1950s and 1960s.29 Telhami tells us that this new Arabism, which emerged toward the latter part of the twentieth century, was centered on intellectual elites and driven by a small sector of the media that was relatively free of govern­mental control. It facilitated expressions of political concern that were Arabist, in the sense that they transcended state bound­aries, and were independent of state governments. This was espe­cially true in the effort to maintain a political focus on the issue of Palestine and Arab relations with Israel.30 Illuminating as Telhamis analysis undoubtedly is, nevertheless, to af.x the same term, that of Arabism, to the Nasir-led movement of the 1950s and 1960s is to so stretch the term as to attenuate its de.nitional clarity. Nasir, after all, led an army of vocal and activist Arab nationalists throughout the length and breadth of the Arab world who believed fervently that the overriding purpose of their political struggle was to return the Arab people to their natural condition, united into one sovereign Arab state. One wonders how many of the new Arabists would take seriously even the remote possibility of such an outcome?",

An Arab living along the banks of the Tigris River may identify him­self also as an Iraqi (his state), a Sunni (his religious sect), and / or a Dulaimi (his tribe). Multiple identities need not necessarily be mutually exclusive. For instance, in his study of Palestinian iden­tity, Rashid Khalidi maintains that intellectuals and politicians in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries identi.ed with the Ottoman Empire, their religion, Arabism, their homeland Pales­tine, their city or region, and their family, without feeling any con­tradiction, or sense of con.icting loyalties.1 However, the narra­tors of the various identities have tended to project their own as the most deserving of paramount loyalty. The power of the narrative is aided or impeded by purposeful environmental changes, events, and accidents of historythe packaging of a nationalist school cur­riculum, a war won or lost, the emergence of a charismatic leader. Over time, and depending on the circumstances, a speci.c identify can become the focus of peoples loyalties, while other identities are marginalized, even excluded. As we shall see, during the 1950s and 1960s Arab nationalism became the peoples focus of loyalty to such an extent that other identities were not only marginalized, but indeed were turned into negative, even derogatory, notions.2 This was no longer the case by the end of the twentieth century, when Arab nationalism seemed to have been eclipsed not only by strong Islamic sentiment, but also by state and substate identities; still, throughout the second half of the century, people continued to cling to their Arabness, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.",

If that were to happen, the world of Islam would be strong again.10 It was this determined declaration of authenticity, this unambiguous reiteration of cultural indepen­dence, even superiority, that later would spur twentieth century nationalists to consider Afghani and Abdu as having contributed to the Arab nationalist cause.11",

The Umma, according to Afghani, constituted all Muslims, regardless of their countries, nationalities, and languages.12 Abdu, too, always spoke of and to the Ummah in the traditional sense of the community of all Muslims.13 As for Arab national and linguistic bonds, these were dismissed by Afghani, who insisted that Muslims had but one nationality: their religion.14 To Afghani and Abdu, the religion of Islam is the one bond which unites Muslims of all countries and obliterates all traces of race or nationality.15 Indeed, they were adamant that it was the foreigners who touted secular nationalism in order to divide the Muslim Umma. Nationalism thus was conceived as a divisive rather than a unifying spirita cover, in fact, for tyranny and injustice.16 Moreover, neither Afghani nor Abdu was particu­larly hostile to Ottoman rule over Arab lands.17 Indeed, Afghani was Persian by birth, and if any nationalism, beyond Muslim unity, is to be implied from Abdus writings, it would be Egyptian rather than Arab.",

Ridas writ­ings on the structure and reform of the Islamic world tended to give Arabs pride of place. To Rida, the Arabic language was the only language in which the doctrines and laws of Islam could be thought about.18 Accordingly, to invest the of.ce of the Khalifa with the Ottoman rulers in Istanbul was a travesty. Indeed, Rida goes even further by insisting that Islam, in fact, had been under­mined by the Ottoman rulers.19 After all, was it not the Turks who tyrannized the community, killing even the Khalifas? Worst of all, in Ridas eyes, the Turks usurped the [of.ce of the Khalifa] from the Abbasids and so took it out from the hands of the Quraysh clan which had been chosen by God to spread the Quran over the world, after it had given Islam its prophet, its language, and its adherents.20 And while the Ottomans had certainly built a great empire, it is dwarfed by the early Arab conquests. In an article Rida wrote in 1900, in which he evaluates Arab and Ottoman conquests, he is adamant in preferring the former: I want to say that the greatest glory in the Muslim conquests goes to the Arabs, and that religion grew, and became great through them; their foundation is the strongest, their light is the brightest, and they are indeed the best Umma.21 In these and other writings, there is no mistaking the conscious ethnic distinction between the Arabs and the Otto­man Turks, in which the pride of place goes to the Arabs. Indeed, later on, in the wake of the 1916 Arab revolt, Rida advocated polit­ical separation and statehood for the Arabs, which, he argued, would be of bene.t to all Muslims.22",

Kawakibi rationalizes what amounts to an incendiary proposal by reference to the central position of the Arabs, and especially their language, in Islam.29 He adds that, unlike other Muslims, the Arabs of the Arabian Penin­sula, not having been weakened by racial and sectarian divisions, continued to constitute a true solidarity, and were the most zealous in preserving their religion. The Arabs, Kawakibi maintained, are of all nations the most suitable to be an authority in religion and an example to the Muslims; the other nations have followed their guidance at the start and will not refuse to follow them now.30 In advocating placing religious authority in the hands of the Arabs, Kawakibi, more so than Rida, infuses a quasi-political dimension to his anti-Turkish sentiment, which is crystallized by his insistence on the transfer of the caliphate to al-Hejaz.",

Note that the proposed khalifa would have only religious authority over the Umma35, and the only temporal authority he was granted by Kawakibi was over al-Hejaz. Indeed, Kawakibi made sure not to call for a break in Ottoman unity.36 Nor did the notion of Arab political separation .gure much in Kawakibis second book, Tabaial-Istibdad (Characteris­tics of Tyranny),37 which focused on the evils of repressive authori­tarian rule and the many virtues of representative government.

These individuals had no qualms about breaking Ottoman unity, promot­ing a separate Arab identity, and advocating an independent politi­cal realm for those whose mother language was Arabic. Perhaps the earliest to advocate the break-up of the Ottoman empire and the creation of an independent Arab state was the Syrian Christian, Negib Azoury (d.1916). Azoury echoed Ridas and Kawakibis contempt for the Turks, but whereas the hostility of Rida and Ka­wakibi lay in what the Turks allegedly did to Islam and the Muslim world, Azoury blamed the Turks for having ruined the Arabs.

Obvious from this designation is the exclusion of Egypt, because Egyptians do not belong to the Arab race; they are of African Berber family and the language which they spoke before Islam bears no similarity to Ara­bic.41 This Arab state was to be a secular, liberal, and constitu­tional sultanate, following in the path of England and France.",

Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha, who con­quered Syria and became its governor in 1833, appealed to the Arabs sense of separateness and to their ethnic and national differ­ences from the Turkish Ottomans. Ibrahim Pasha, during his years in Syria tried hard to stimulate an Arab national consciousness. After more than three centuries of being part of an all-inclusive Ottoman empire, the Arabs for the .rst time could ponder their separateness from those who ruled over them. Antonius relates that these initial national stirrings came to nothing primarily because of British opposition. In 1833, the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, explained his antipathy to an Arab kingdom under Muhamed Ali: There might be no harm in such a thing in itself; but as it would imply the dismemberment of Turkey, we could not agree to it. Besides, Turkey is as good an occupier of the road to India as an active Arabian sovereign would be.49",

Antonius asserts that the Arab national movement may be said to have uttered its .rst cry61 with the poem by the Lebanese Christian, Ibrahim Yaziji, whose .rst line exhorts the Arabs to arise and awaken. In Antoniuss view, the poem did much to foster the national movement in its infancy . . . with its utterance, the movement for political emancipation sang its .rst song.62 Be that as it may, it is interesting that the dramatic nationalist exhortation of the poems .rst line is followed by appeals to the Muslims to forget religious divisions and abjure fanaticism [and to] remember that among the Arabs there are both Christians and Muslims.63 Indeed, the Beirut secret society which was organized in 1875 by Yaziji and four other Christians, and to which Antonius attaches great importance for its impact on the Arab national movement,64 .oundered in 18821883 for lack of Muslim support.65 Moreover, Antoniuss claim that the society was formed to liberate Arab lands from Istanbul, is disputed by Zeine N.

In reality, however, the terms on which the revolt was originally launched had little to do with Arab nationalism. William Cleveland asserts that the revolt was proclaimed in the name of preserving Islam, not in the name of Arabism or the Arab nation.74 Aziz al-Azmeh is more categorical: The Arab Revolt . . . does not belong to the register of . . . Arab nationalism, and it really ought to be excised from the chronicles of Arab nationalism. It was Arab only in the narrow ethnological, pre-nationalist sense. It was an Islamist rebellion, undertaken in the name not of the Arabs, but of a Meccan Caliphate under the Sharif Husayn bin Ali.75 Indeed, Husayn himself felt that the Arabs would unite only under the ban­ner of Islam.76 It was hardly surprising, therefore, that Sharif Hu­ sayn would characterize the Young Turks as impious innovators who had put Islam in danger, thus justifying his call to arms against the Turks as a defense of the faith.77 The sharif and his sons were indeed cognizant of the hostility of the Arab Muslims to their re­volt, which explains, if not wholly, at least partially, why the revolt was couched in Islamic rather than Arab symbolism. The sharifs third son, Prince Faysal, who was to become King of Syria for a short period, and then King of Iraq, con.ded that the position of the Shari.an family had become dif.cult after Muslims accused it of destroying the Islamic (Ottoman) Empire.78 And in any case, the Arab nationalist credentials of Sharif Husayn himself are rather questionable. C. Ernest Dawn has persuasively shown that up to 1914 Husayn was a loyal supporter of the Ottoman Empire, who was not averse to using his Arab forces in support of Turkish troops against the Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula.79 He rebelled against Istanbul only after the Ottomans rejected his demands for a hereditary monarchy in al-Hejaz.",

Ernest Dawn） 令人信服地表明，直到 1914 年，侯赛因一直是奥斯曼帝国的忠实支持者，他并不反对使用他的阿拉伯军队支持土耳其军队对抗阿拉伯半岛的阿拉伯人。79 直到奥斯曼帝国拒绝他在汉志实行世袭君主制的要求后，他才反抗伊斯坦布尔。"

To them, it was the glitter of British gold and the promise of ample bounty that rallied the Hejaz bedouins behind the Sharif.84 Tribal chiefs would negotiate end­lessly over remunerations until military operations were delayed, and once paid, many would withdraw from the sharifs war. If they felt any duty or commitment, it was to the British monetary coin­age. In this part of the world, observed a British military advisor to the shari.an army, gold is now so plentiful that the British sovereign may almost be said to be the unit of coinage.85 And according to T. E.

After all, no fewer than 300,000 Arabs fought in the Ottoman army during the war.87 Egypts response to the sharifs revolt was avowedly hostile. The Egyptian newspaper, al-Ahram, rhetorically asked whether the revolt was really a nationalist appeal, and its answer was an em­phatic no, for the Turkish people as a whole have not tried to deprive other races from their birthright.88 Antonius, himself, con­cedes this antipathy within Egypt, describing it as real and scarcely veiled [deriving] its strength from anti-British as much as from pro-Turkish sentiment.89 But Antonius is more charitable to the Syrians and Iraqis who, he claims, responded to the shari.an revolt with universal enthusiasm.90 Later historical studies, how­ever, do not support such a sweeping contention. Hasan Kayali, for instance, maintains that the preponderance of localist and Otto­manist attitudes resulted in Syrian ambivalence about Sharif Hu­sayns revolt.91 Philip Khoury goes even further. He argues that Syrias urban notables, constituting the political leadership, not only did not embrace the revolt, but actually saw it as a treasonous act.92 As we have seen, Faysal, the sharifs son, conceded that Mus­lims generally blamed his family for destroying the Islamic (Otto­man) empire.93 No wonder then that as late as 1918, when the tide of war was clearly turning against the Ottomans, Lawrence in a secret dispatch to London would write that a spontaneous anti-Ottoman rebellion in Syria was an impossibility.94",

He learned Turkish and French before he studied Arabic, and until the end of his life this intellectual prophet of Arab nationalism would speak Arabic with a slight Turkish accent. He went on to study in Europe where he was exposed to the competing intellec­tual strands of European nationalism. On his return, he joined the Ottoman bureaucracy, where he eventually held senior posts in the Balkan provinces of the empire at a time when the national, anti-Ottoman movements in these provinces were gathering momen­tum. The Balkan experience provided him with much food for thought, and later in his enunciations on Arab nationalism, he would refer time and again to the experiences of various Balkan countries as they strove for national independence. During World War I, Istanbul sent him to Syria as the director general of educa­tion. He held high-ranking and in.uential portfolios in the sector of education during Faysals reign in Syria and in Iraq. Due partly to his voluminous writings and extensive teaching and lecturing, and partly to the immense in.uence he wielded on the educational system in Iraqs .rst two decades, Husri was able to make nation­alist ideas the central thrust of the countrys educational and cul­tural policies. Echoing Fichtes belief that only through education could a nation be reborn, Husri sought to inculcate into the peo­ple, especially the young, a clear and durable sense of Arab na­tional identity that would supercede other prevalent identities, such as tribalism, regionalism, and sectarianism. He saw his mis­sion as promoting national consciousness through the creation of national educational systems.",

Originally de­veloped by Johann Gottfried Herder in late eighteenth century, the volk was not simply the people of a country, but a metaphys­ical entity de.ned relationally as that which produces a partic­ular language, art, culture, set of great men, religion and collection of customs. All of these things are taken, not as products of indi­vidual men but as manifestations of the spirit of the people, or volksgeist.25 To the rationalist philosophers of the Enlighten­ment, volksgeist was of little value since humanity was invariable, transcending cultural differences, and therefore the ideas and princi­ples derived from it were universally applicable, regardless of the variations in peoples customs from one locality to another. Here lies the point of departure for Herder and the German romantic nationalists. To them, people are always found in divided groups which have evolved a language and culture in response to their envi­ronment and which express their own national character. In the succession of generations, a people elaborates and develops that culture, and each individual man is what he is because oneoran­other culture has stamped itself upon him.26 (italics added) It is this formulation that shapes the intellectual underpinning for the notion of cultural nationalism. A nation is not a sociopolitical con­struct; it cannot be, since it resides through an immemorial past in the very being of its people, imposing on them a homogeneity and uniformity that separates them from other human groups.

The need of Arab nationalists to re-create the real and mythical glories that resided in a distant period in their history would become all the more urgent.39 In short, and in the telling words of Elie Keddourie, nationalists make use of the past in order to subvert the present.40 This may sound somewhat fero­cious, but in fact it is not at all far from the truth.

To Rousseau, it was the test of education to give to each human being a national form, and so direct his opinions and tastes, that he should be a patriot by inclination, by passion, by necessity. On .rst opening his eyes, a child must see his country, and until he dies must see nothing else.42 While Rousseaus ideas were the source of lively intellectual debate during his lifetime, it was the French revolution, less than two decades after Rousseaus death, that vigorously put his ideas into practice. The leaders of the French Revolution recog­nized from the very beginning the pivotal role education would play in uniting the people and the fatherland. A comprehensive system of education, the .rst of its kind in Europe, was instituted for the purpose of creating patriotic citizenry, of turning peasants into citizens.43 The teaching of patriotic history replaced the clas­sics, and the arts, especially music, were geared to arousing na­tional pride and passion. Schools adopted an aggressive language curriculum where French was taught as the only national language at the expense of the native idioms formerly taught among Basques, Bretons, Alsatians, Catalans, Flemish, and Provenc¸eaux. Higher education received the same treatment,44 where Latin and classical authors gave way to French and French writers.",

Since languages differ between races, it is natural that we .nd groups of individuals who share the same language drawing nearer to each other than to other groups, thereby forming a nation which is distinct from other nations.52 As examples, Husri points to the Germans and Italians who, through the preservation of their language, were able eventu­ally to turn chronic political fragmentation into uni.ed states. Husri cites too the example of Bulgaria before World War I, which, Husri relates, suffered from two kinds of oppression. There was the intrusion of the Greek Orthodox Church, which sought to spread the Greek language at the expense of Bulgarian, and there was the Ottoman imperial subjugation of Bulgaria, which was po­litical in nature, and thus not particularly opposed to the Bulgarian language. Husris argument was that the Bulgarians could not struggle for political independence from the Ottomans without .rst achieving linguistic and cultural freedom from the Greeks. Indeed, he points out, that only after a revival of the Bulgarian language had taken place, which was due in great measure to the establish­ment of a Bulgarian patriarchate which replaced Greek with Bul­garian as the language of worship and education, could the Bulgari­ans begin their quest for independence from the Ottomans.53 Indeed, Husri discerns similar conclusions from the case of Poland, where he argues that the Polish language played a pivotal role not only in keeping the Polish nation alive after the partitioning of Po­land, but also in later uniting the country again. In the Arab case, Husris lifelong advocacy for the adoption of standard Arabic throughout the Arab world was occasioned by a recognition that Arab dialects were so varied as to make nonsense of the notion of linguistic unity.",

On the other hand, universal religions, such as Islam and Christianity, which are embraced by people of different languages, cultures, and locale, must by de.ni­tion be opposed to nationalism. And in such a competition, Husri is con.dent that human solidarity built around religious af.liation would not stand up to the force of secular cultural nationalism.

What is to prevent Iraqfrom dreaming about uniting the Arab lands now that it has achieved its dream of becoming independent?1 Such hopes of Arab uni.cation seemed to be well invested in Iraq. The national­ists would look back to the past and proudly point to the glittering civilization that .ourished in Baghdad under the Abbasid Dynasty at a time when the West languished in the darkness of its medieval ages. By the middle of the ninth century, scholars working in the immense library of Baghdads Bayt al Hikma (The House of Wis­dom) had translated and commented on the main works of Aris­totle, Plato, Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen.

Egypt, the most advanced Arabic-speaking country, was the natural leader, and should have taken the helm of the Arab nationalist march. But it was not willing to assume that role. While the countrys Arab identity was grow­ing, it still resided squarely in the shadow of the far more dominant Egyptian identity.

Because of their minority sta­tus in Iraq, it was natural that the Sunnis would gravitate emotion­ally as well as rationally outward toward the other Arabs, almost all of whom belonged to the Sunni sect of Islam. Even so, while not in similar numbers or with quite the same ease, more of the educated urban non-Sunni Iraqis were also joining the nationalist ranks. In this, there can be little doubt that the educational system instituted by the state was the prime agent in the socialization of Iraqi citizens to Arab nationalist culture.5 The swelling of the ranks was evident in the widespread demonstrations that occurred in Baghdad in response to the Syrian revolt against the French (1925 1927), to the visit to Iraqin 1928 of the British Zionist Sir Alfred Mond, and to the 1929 Arab riots against the Jews in Palestine over what came to be known as the Wailing Wall incident.

Unlike Iraqand Egypt, both of which had a measure of political independence, Syria dur­ing this period was under French mandate. It is hardly surprising then that Syrias energy was focused overwhelmingly on attaining Syrian independence from the French. Syrias political leadership came from urban notables who had risen to positions of political eminence under the Ottoman Empire. During the mandate period, those leaders formed themselves into the National Bloc. The Blocs nationalism generally was localized, aimed at the mandate power. Concerns with the wider Arab arena were not a priority. And in any case, the notables were moved less by ideological fervor than by their socioeconomic and political interests. The urban lead­ers, Philip Khoury tells us, shaped nationalism into an instru­ment by which to create a more desirable balance between them­selves and the French. And they molded their movement to suit the particular interests of their class. In their hands, nationalism . . . was a means to win French recognition without upsetting the status quo.7 The notables, thus, were too preoccupied with the French, too protective of their own class interests to seriously extend their brand of nationalism beyond the borders of Syria.",

It is ironic be­cause, according to Husri and other nationalist theoreticians and activists, it is the Arabic language that ultimately de.nes the param­eters of the Arab nation. Of course, the reference here is to standard classical Arabic. But this Arabic was the domain of the literate, who constituted only a small minority of the population. During this period, no less than four out of .ve Arabs depended almost exclusively on the spoken word for communication. And spoken Arabic consisted of a vast array of suf.ciently differentiated dia­lects that in many instances it was dif.cult (sometimes downright impossible) for an Arab from one part of the Arab world to communicate with other Arabs from a different part of the Arab world. Sati al-Husri was fully aware of this problem.

A Palestinian teacher attempted to raise his students consciousness about mounting Jewish immigration in Palestine. On the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, the teacher and some of his students took to the streets shouting Down with Balfour! Having no idea what the Balfour Declaration was, the towns people joined the demon­stration shouting Down with Karkour! On hearing this, Kar­kour, the local shoemaker, was compelled to run into the street and defend his good name.23 With the probable exception of nonurban Palestinian locales,24 this incident could well have occurred in any small town or village along the length and breadth of the Arabic-speaking world.",

Indeed, they exerted inordinate in.uence on peoples fundamental attitudes in Husris own backyard, the Kingdom of Iraq. As we shall see, the Sunni-Shiite divide undermined efforts at national unity both at the Iraqi and Arab levels. And this was exacerbated by a tribal struc­ture that not only resisted governmental control, but also was a focus of primordial loyalty for the people. Sectarianism was also a problem for Syria with its Sunni-Druze-Alawite divide, and in some Syrian regions, especially Latakiya, Jabal Druze, and Jezzira, entrenched tribal attitudes further impeded national consolidation. Throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s, tribes constituted the main problem facing the nascent administration of Trans-Jordan. Tribes constantly waged war against each other and raided settled communities at will. They rarely paid taxes, and maintained tribal law in de.ance of central authority. It was not until the British commander John Glubb created the Desert Patrol in the early 1930s that tribal con.icts subsided. The genius of the plan resided in Glubbs successful effort to channel the bedouins warlike energy and co-opt their services in defense of the state. Consequently, the Desert Patrol, and indeed the whole Arab Legion (Jordans armed forces), continued throughout the years to consciously manifest strong tribal ties and attitudes. The strength of Jordanian tribal ties is echoed in many other parts of the Arab world. Bassam Tibi writes: Neither in the imperial nor in the territorial state were tribes transformed into a homogenous polity; tribal ties have al­ways been the basic element of group reference, despite the fact that they were suppressed and rhetorically renounced. This hap­pened in the past within the framework of a universal Islamic Umma and in the present with reference to the secular idea of the nation.25 In some cases, tribalism and sectarianism overlapped with one another, thereby reinforcing the anti-national impulse. The Shiite tribal confederations in Iraqare a case in point, so are the Alawite and Druze tribal communities of Syria.",

Lebanon was a geographically small area with a politically in.uential Christian population that was singularly hostile to any notion of Arab unity. Jordan was perceived throughout the Arab world as an arti.cial and inconse­quential creation by the British to pacify Emir Abdallah. Palestine was a hotbed of national sentiment, and in Haj Amin al-Husayni, Palestinians had a popular nationalist leader whose in.uence ex­tended beyond the con.nes of Palestine. The country, however, was already a contested domain, oscillating precariously between a Jewish and an Arab identity. And in any case, during this period, many Arabs perceived Palestine (as well as Lebanon and Jordan) as an intrinsic part of Greater Syria, Bilad al-Sham. Finally, on the level of political institutions, Iraq, Egypt, and increasingly Syria, were forging rapidly ahead of the other parts of the Arab world. Consequently, the actual and perceived centrality of these three countries in the Arab world of the 1920s and 1930s was such that whatever the outcome of the debates over the various identities, and whatever the direction of the political struggle, the consequent impact was sure to be felt not just locally, but throughout the Arab world.",

The facts tell a different story. To begin with, very few people partici­pated in the uprisingno more than ten thousand, half of whom were Druze tribesmen. Some support came from workers in the cities of Damascus and Hama, and from a few Muslim merchants who saw the revolt as a way of undermining their Christian com­petitors, but only a small minority of notables joined in.

The main reason for this was that the community itself was divided tribally, geographically and by religious sub­sects.47 Their energy was consumed by internal dissension and bick­ering.

Although outlawed and constantly harassed by the French, the party rapidly gained adher­ents among the urban populations, becoming an important player among the radical underground opposition. Indeed, by the end of World War II, it had a broad popular base, a fact that did not escape the attention of the indigenous leaderships of the newly in­dependent states of Syria and Lebanon. In July 1949, Saada was arrested, and within twenty-four hours summarily tried and exe­cuted. By the time of Saadas death, the SSNP had grown into a major political force, so much so that Sati al-Husri, necessarily an antagonist, was moved to declare in 1948: There is no party in the Arab world which can compete with the SSNP for the quality of its propaganda, which in.uences reason as well as the emotions, and for the strength of its organization, which is as ef.cient on the surface as it is underground.53 The party remained a force well into the 1950s, eventually to be eclipsed by the spectacular ascent of Arab nationalism during that decade.",

This pharaonic orientation (al-Nuza al-.raw­niya) had gathered support with the extensive excavations that took place after Napoleons invasion of Egypt.57 Moreover, during the nineteenth century, Egypt had tread a historical path that was markedly different from the rest of the Arab world. Muhamed Ali and his successors had established an independent dynasty that was attached to the Ottoman Empire in nothing but name.

After the collapse of nationalist rule in Syria in 1920, Husri and other mem­bers of the short-lived Arab government made their way to Egypt expecting widespread support. They were to be bitterly disap­pointed. Most [Egyptians] did not care about the events in Syria, recalls Husri. Even the collapse of the Syrian Arab State itself en­gendered among them no amount of regret that is worth noting. And why this indifference? Husris answer is unequivocal: they did not possess an Arab nationalist sentiment; did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands, and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation.59 And to Husris chagrin, the Egyptians seemed to keep Arab nationalist concerns at arms length into the 1930s, for he relates in his mem­oirs that in 1931 a group of Egyptian students and their professors were visibly astonished when their Iraqi hosts broached the subject of Arab nationalism.60 Indeed, to most Egyptians, who for centu­ries had been settled cultivators, the word Arab conjured up the image of the contemptuous, indolent nomad.61 Thus, the eminent Arab historian and thinker, Nicola Ziadeh says emphatically, that from the end of the nineteenth century until World War II, national­ism to the Egyptian meant essentially Egyptian nationalism and the nationalist struggle was perceived as exclusively an Egyptian struggle against foreign control.62 In light of this cultural proclivity, any assault on Arab nationalism could be mounted with an impres­ sive array of arguments steeped in the symbolism of a well-devel­oped Egyptian identity.",

Some of Egypts most prominent literary .gures assailed the Arabs, their inferior culture, and their archaic customs and traditions. Abbas Muhamed al-Aqqad, a literary giant of the period who differenti­ated the cultured Egyptian nation from bedouin nations,63 and who saw Egyptian art as superior to Arabic art,64 wrote of the exis­tence of a wide gulf between the retrogressive mentality of the Arabs and the progressive outlook of twentieth century Egyptians, which was focused on the possibilities of the future rather than on the past. Aqqad accordingly counseled Egyptians to blot out the memory of our past Arab centuries lest we ourselves be asphyxi­ated by the dust of these centuries.65 Salame Musa, another emi­nent Egyptian intellectual of the period, agreed: We do not owe the Arabs any loyalty. Our youth should not spend too much time on Arab culture. We need to get them accustomed to writing ac­cording to modern Egyptian methods than to archaic Arab styles. And they need to know that we are superior to the Arabs.66 And why this purposeful separation? Because, to Musa, Egypts funda­mental connection is not with the Arabs, but with Europe from which Egypt took its contemporary culture and civilization.67 Taha Husayn, the dean of modern Egyptian letters, in perhaps his most in.uential book, Mustaqbal al-Thaqafa . Misr (The Future of Cul­ture in Egypt), likewise distanced Egypt from its Arab past, arguing that Egyptian civilization was older than any other civilization, and that the country had retained a distinctive identity through its pharaonic past. In terms of culture and ways of thinking, Husayn maintains that Egypt had always been a part of Europe,68 and he tellingly minimizes the importance of Arabic as Egypts national language and Islam as its religion, since neither language nor reli­gion is a primary element of nation building.69 To the renowned novelist and philosopher, Taw.qal-Hakim, Egypt and the Arabs were diametrically opposed in spirit and intellect. This is more than evident in his celebrated novel, Awdat al-Ruh (The Return of the Soul), in which he contrasts the basic decency of the Egyptian with the militant bellicosity of the Arab bedouin.70 It is of course true that not all of Egypts intellectuals shared this Egyptian wata­niya orientation. As we have seen, Arab nationalism had its vigor­ous supporters. However, during this particular period, the weight of considered intellectual opinion in Egypt was in favor of a uniquely Egyptian identity at the expense of an all encompassing Arab identity, which was depicted as spiritually bankrupt and intel­lectually backward.",

This was re.ected in the attitudes and policies of the ruling elites. In 1925, when the possibilities of Arab unity were brought to him, Saad Zaghloul Pasha, the father of Egyptian independence, responded: If you add one zero to another zero, then you add another zero, what will be the sum?75 This comment seems to re.ect the general attitude of Egypts political elites. The Syrian uprising in 1925, and Frances brutal response galvanized many Egyptians into extending material and verbal support to the heroic Syrians. But even on such a dramatic occasion, the gov­ernment moved slowly and cautiously, almost in spite of itself. There were no of.cial statements regarding the revolt, and there is no record that the government intervened diplomatically in sup­port of the Syrian cause. Moreover, when Zaghloul (who was out of power then) .nally addressed the nation on the subject, he re­ferred to Egyptians and Syrians being linked together as Eastern­ers.76 The concern of the government and the ruling circle with the revolt was short-lived, quickly and almost thankfully dis­carded. This hardly suggests a strong attachment to Arab national­ism, even when British in.uence over Egypts decision-making pro­cess is taken into consideration.",

The majority of Syri­ans, wracked by their own divisions, did not see unity with Iraq or Egypt as a priority. But as we have seen, the Syrians were undoubt­edly sensitive to political developments in other Arab countries. The same was true of the other Arabic-speaking regions and coun­tries of the Middle East. We saw how Egypt, the most distant from Arab nationalism, was moved, at least at the popular level, by the Syrian uprising against the French in 19251927; indeed there was enough public clamor that the recalcitrant politicians were com­pelled to make public statements supporting the Syrian revolt. But the one issue that consistently found an echo among the urban, educated Arabic-speaking populations of the Middle East was the increasing danger of Jewish immigration into Palestine. Here was a concern that would unite the Arab nationalist, the Islamist, and the believer in Greater Syria. From their different loyalties and per­spectives, they all would agree on the need to resist the demo­graphic changes that were under way in Palestine. The expansion in educational opportunities, the introduction of the radio, and the proliferation of newspapers in the interwar period made the Pales­tinian issue that more accessible. As early as 1928, the visit to Bagh­dad by a well-known British Zionist, Alfred Mond, was met with widespread street demonstrations.1 But on the whole, popular con­cern was not echoed in of.cial pronouncements and policies.

Popular agitation was such that members of Parliament raised the issue several times, demanding swift and meaningful government action, and a group of them embarked on organizing an international conference on the Palestinian problem, which eventually met in October 1938 under the title, World Par­liamentary Congress of Arab and Muslim Countries for the De­fense of Palestine.12 The convening of the Congress in Cairo, and the anti-British undercurrents which it displayed at a time when the British held an unquestionable position of in.uence in the coun­try, is a testimony to the strength of the pro-Palestinian sentiments sweeping Egypt in the wake of the Arab revolt.",

Busi­nessmen worried that Jewish ascendancy would eventually lead to the establishment of a Jewish state. Such a state could become an economic threat to Egypt by forming a physical barrier that, at a minimum, would hinder the countrys commercial relations with the Near East markets. If Zionism [were to be] established in Pal­estine, wrote one prominent Egyptian businessman, its harm [would] not be limited to Palestine alone. Rather, it [would] imme­diately extend to affect the destiny of all the neighboring countries, to place limits on their economies, industries, trade, wealth and independence.13 Beyond the economic issue, Egyptians had a wider geostrategic concern. It was felt that a Jewish state would be a catalyst for constant tension and crises that would lead to situa­tions of chronic unrest which in turn would invite foreign interven­tions. Moreover, the pressures of continuous immigration would inevitably push the Jewish state to expand into more Arab lands, depriving more Arab people of their homes and their livelihood. Thus the Palestinian question could not and would not be limited to Palestine; it was, and, in the case of the creation of a Jewish state, would always be a problem for the Arab and Muslim worlds. These fears were expressed succinctly by Muhamed Husayn Hay­kal, a leading Egyptian intellectual, who was also an in.uential liberal political .gure. To Haykal, the situation in Palestine, partic­ularly if the British partition plan were to be implemented, would have a deleterious impact on Egypts future which is .rmly linked to the destinies of the lands which neighbor us and are in.uenced by us as we are in.uenced by themin the security of our country, in the sale of our products, in the shaping of our international rela­tions, in the organization of our self-defense, and in the de.nition of our policy in the Mediterranean.14",

As these bilateral talks progressed throughout 1943 and well into 1944, emphasizing Egypts determination to etch for itself a leading role, Arab nationalist narrators in Egypt endeavored intellectually to legitimize Egypts political initiative by emphasizing Egypts historical Arab roots. Perhaps the most prominent and committed of these narrators, Abd al-Rahman Azzam, who later became the .rst secretary general of the Arab League in 1945, would write somewhat expansively that Egypt was an Arab country before the time of Christ.44 It is important to note that the effort at legitimation was directed at Egyptians, not at the other Arabs. Regardless of whether they were truly con­vinced that Egypt was genuinely committed to the Arab nationalist cause, nationalists in other Arab countries were nevertheless jubi­lant that Egypt was beginning to consider itself a part of the Arab world.45",

In the 1920s, no more than 2 percent of the population in the Arabic-speaking world could claim to have had some education,51 and much of it was at the primary level provided by private institutions, particu­larly religious establishments. By the 1940s, education had ex­panded considerably. For example, enrollment in Egyptian second­ary schools rose from about 5,000 in 1920 to 120,000 in 1951, and those attending universities increased from 3,000 in 1925 to 32,000 in 1950.52 More to the point, the expansion in education in Egypt produced a new effendiya class (essentially an urban, literate, and professional stratum), which had a less westernized social background. This new class, unlike an earlier generation, was thus oriented less toward Europe and the West and more to­ward Arabism and Islam.53 In Iraq, too, the secondary school popu­lation grew considerably from 229 in 1921 to 13,969 by 1940, an increase paralleled by the growth of the college student population from 99 to 1,218 during the same period.54 An important by-prod­uct of the spread of secular education in Iraq was the gradual reduction of the sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shiites. This happened as secularist and nationalist values, propagated by the states school system, reached the Shiites in increasing numbers.55 Moreover, whereas only .fteen Iraqi students graduated from college in 1921all lawyersthere were 1,091 graduates from nine different colleges in 1951.56 In Syria, which did not become independent until 1945, a rapid expansion in education over the next .ve years doubled the number of primary school students, and quadrupled the number of secondary school students.57 The bulk of the students in the three countries, especially Egypt and Iraq, were receiving their education from state schools. By the 1950s, private schools were a distinct minority, and religious schools tended to be strictly supervised by the state. Consequently, secular and nationalist values on the whole were inculcated into the growing student populations.",

The Israelis were a prime bene.­ciary of such inter-Arab suspicions.63 The result was a political .asco and a military debacle. The Arab populations, told to expect swift victory, waited expectantly for the fruits of the Arabs united action. Instead they were witness to Arab armies and governments competing for their own slice of Palestine, and for the glory that would be accrued by them individually.

In October, mem­bers of the hierarchy of Syrias ruling Peoples Party, which was traditionally close to the Iraqis, opened negotiations with Baghdad for some form of union between the two countries. While the Syri­ans sought a loose federation that would maintain their republican political order, the Iraqis went for a more organic union. They de­ manded a centralized federal leadership, a common diplomatic corps, .nancial and monetary integration, and the merger of the two armies under a uni.ed command.67 Perceiving it as essentially a union that would bolster the regional power not only of Hashem­ite Iraq, but also of its great-power ally, Britain, the initiative was coolly received among the governments and populations of the Arab world. Even in Iraq, opposition was widespread, not just from the usual suspects, in this case the Kurds and Shiites, the tradi­tional opponents of Arab unity initiatives, but also from an appre­ciable segment of the Sunni population.68 These individuals felt that it was not so much Arab nationalism, but the personal political ambitions of the universally disliked Iraqi regent, Prince Abd al-Illah, that determined Iraqs quest for union and its negotiating position and tactics in the talks. Most consequentially, antagonism to unity with Iraq was prevalent among the ranks of the Syrian army. The Syrian of.cers were determined not to be hoodwinked into a union with monarchical Iraq, and were adamant about pre­serving the independence of Syrias institutions.69 Distrustful of their governments motivations and wary about Hashemite inten­tions, the Syrian army decided to make its move before the talks came to fruition. On December 19, the army executed a successful coup and immediately severed talks with the Iraqis. While the mili­tary coup was not necessarily an anti-qawmi move, it nevertheless exhibited an increasing sense of Syrian wataniya, a tendency to measure the ef.cacy of unity initiatives in light of their costs and bene.ts to Syria.",

We spoke of nothing but our country and how to deliver it.1 At one time, when Nasir and his unit were trapped by the Israelis, he saw this predicament as a metaphor for Egypts own entrapment: What is happening to us here is a picture in miniature of what is happening in Egypt.2 Nasir was disgusted with the incompetence of the Egyptian High Command, and sick­ened by the corruption of governmental departments responsible for supplying weapons which were frequently more dangerous to the user than to the enemy.3 Such ideas were hardly unique to Nasir; they were on the minds of many of the Egyptian army of.­cers, who returned to Egypt defeated and humiliated, echoing in their hearts the exhortation of one of their fallen comrades to re­member that the real battle [was] in Egypt.4",

When he searched for ways of deliverance from British imperialism, his concern was directed primarily at Egypt, even though other Arab countries suffered the same fate. If other Arabs came to mind, it was only in ways to help bring about Egypts salvation.5 One reason for pushing the Arab dimension to the margins of his concerns was the practical consideration that Egypt, with all of its internal problems, could ill-afford to be mired into the turbulence of Arab politics. But there was also another, perhaps more fundamental reason: Nasir was simply echoing the dominant political sentiments of his countrymen. It is true, as we have seen, that the Arab ideological trend had gathered momentum in Egypt, especially after the 19361939 Arab revolt in Palestine; it is equally true, however, that Arab nationalism did not achieve ideological primacy in Egypt. Egyptian, rather than Arab, national­ism continued to be the dominant ideology. Its roots dug so deep into the Egyptian soul that even by the end of the 1950s, the decade that witnessed the greatest triumphs of Arab nationalism under Egypts own leadership, observers would note Egyptian indiffer­ence to the Arab identity. The Syrian Salah al-Din Bitar, who along with Michel A.aq, founded the Arab nationalist Bath Party, and who became a member of the .rst cabinet of the United Arab Re­ public (UAR), which was formed in 1958 through the organic union of Egypt and Syria under Nasirs leadership, stated categori­cally that Nasirs conversion to Arab nationalism only began around 19531954, adding that the Arab idea never went very deep in Egypt.6 Even if Bitars evaluation could be dismissed as an invective by a disillusioned Syrian (which he certainly became by the last years of the union), then the words of Muhamed Hasaneen Haykal, Nasirs con.dant and the most in.uential Egyptian jour­nalist of the Nasirist era, are less easy to dismiss.

Rapid population growth, changes to traditional economic rela­tions, accelerated migrations from rural to urban areas, and the spread of modern public education had produced a social and intel­lectual milieu that was ready for revolutionary picking. The most consequential of these changes occurred in education. In Egypt, stu­dents in secondary schools increased from 15,000 in 1933 to 41,000 in 1951.13 As late as 19391940, there were only 4,000 pupils in seven Syrian state secondary schools; by 19551956, Syria could boast 258 state secondary schools with an enrollment of 60,000 pupils.14 In Iraq, only 200 students received a secondary education in 1920, yet by 1958, there were 74,000 students in secondary schools.15 In this, the educational bene.ts were not con.ned to the politically dominant Sunni population; they accrued to the Shiites as well.16 This was re.ected in the expansion of higher education, where in 1951, 1,091 students received degrees from nine different colleges.17 True, even these dramatic improvements constituted no more than between 25 and 35 percent of all school-age children, nevertheless, they contributed signi.cantly to the expansion of a literate and politically aware middle class, which actively assumed a leadership role in the propagation of radical nationalism. As we shall see, much of the political turbulence that characterized the 1950s was fomented by countless street demonstrations and riots begun by student populations, and supported, in many cases vigor­ously, by other sectors of the middle class, particularly and most consequentially the of.cer corps of the armed forces. Of course, the process of social change, including the expansion in education, had started in the interwar years, but its consequencessocial tension, political restlessness, and a broader awareness that challenged tradi­tional political ideas and practicespeaked in the 1950s.",

As we have seen, Sati al-Husri, even though a Syrian, whose intel­lectual output occurred primarily in Iraq, nevertheless accepted un­equivocally Egypts centrality in the Arab world, declaring it to be the only possible leader of Arab nationalism.25 And this perception was prevalent in the Arab world. As one Syrian of.cial put it, The Arabs have always considered Egypt as the headquarters of Arab nationalism due to its geographic, social and cultural position.26 Echoing this sentiment, an Iraqi nationalist leader insisted that Egypt was a strong foundation and a vital and sure base for the Arab nation. He added that Iraq could not act as such a base, because Iraq did not possess the capability to assume this posi­ tion. However, it was well within Egypts capability.27 This en­trenched belief in Egypts dominance and centrality meant that other Arabs would be wary of pursuing any project that would not, at a minimum, receive Egypts blessings. For instance, the Syrian Michel A.aq, who founded the Bath Party, conceded that there could be no Arab unity without Egypt because she could and would successfully oppose any movement toward Arab unity which excluded her.28 In the same vein, Egypts threat to withdraw from the Arab League in August 1962 prompted President Fuad Shihab of Lebanon to appeal to Nasir to change his mind on the grounds that the league will have no value if [Egypt] withdrew from it, since Egypt was the Leagues biggest and strongest mem­ber state.29 Most tellingly, was the admission of King Faysal of Saudi Arabia, who at various times had been the linchpin of the anti-Nasirist forces in the region, to Nasir that his father, King Abd al-Aziz, the founder of Saudi Arabia, had given his children one piece of advice: He told us to pay attention to Egypts role, for without Egypt, the Arabs throughout history would have been without value.30 These attitudes point to the .rm belief held by Arabs that Arab nationalism could only .ourish with Egypts ac­tive involvement. The committed nationalist might have believed that an Arab nation, united in thought and action, was a revolu­tionary juggernaut that would sweep aside all doubters and ene­mies in its victorious march toward independence and progress. But the believer also knew that Iraq, Syria, Jordan, or Saudi Arabia could not be the driving engine of this juggernaut; only Egypt could .ll this role.",

Like no other Egyptian or Arab leader before him, or among his contempo­raries, Nasir recognized the immense power of radio, a power which, as a dazzling orator, he had used vigorously and effectively. From early in the regimes tenure, Nasir devoted considerable .­nancial resources to the expansion of public broadcasting. The Voice of the Arabs started its radio transmissions to the Arab world in July 1953. The timing is instructive. Less than two months earlier, Nasir had rejected the idea of a Western alliance submitted to him by John Foster Dulles, becoming convinced in the process that the U. S. secretary of state would pursue other, possibly more pliant, Arab countries. The creation of the Voice of the Arabs was thus a function of Nasirs utilitarian approach to Arab politics rather than an af.rmation of his ideological commitment to the Arab idea. The transmission time of the new station was increased threefold in January 1954, and it declared unequivocally that the Voice of the Arabs speaks for the Arabs, struggles for them and expresses their unity.34 On another occasion, the Arabs were re­minded that Egypt was in the service of the Arab nation and its struggle against Western imperialism and its lackeys in the Arab world.35 The language should have warned Arab leaders of things to come. The radio station became Nasirs main vehicle in propa­gating his views, which on many occasions contrasted sharply with the views of other Arab leaders. Egypts domestic service, Radio Cairo, was similarly expanded to cover much of the Arab world, and together with the Voice of the Arabs became primary agents of instability in countries such as Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.",

Their own services were so rudimentary that they were unable to lure listeners away from Egyptian programming. Moreover, they had virtually no jamming capability.

Jamalis argument rested on a main pillar of international law, that of the inviolability of state sovereignty. Iraq had the unquestioned sovereign right, Jamali asserted, to pursue its national interest with­out the interference of other states.

Arab nationalism, Nasir argued, took precedence over any other consid­eration, even state sovereignty. Since Arab nationalism was the pri­mary ideological and emotional identi.cation of every Arab, then, according to Nasir, Egypt had not just the right, but the duty to intrude into the affairs of other countries that were not conducting themselves in accordance with Arab nationalist principles.

The Party was the brainchild of two young Syrian intellectuals, Michel A.aq and Salah al-Din Bitar, who had formed a close friendship while studying in Paris in the 1930s. A.aq, who assumed the role of the Partys philosopher, spent his entire career asserting the validity of the notion of an indivisible Arab nation. This nation, according to A.aq, had been forcibly divided by colonialism and imperialism, a division that had led to a degeneration of the Arab spirit. The major goal of the Bath Party was to reverse this trend and rejuve­nate the Arab will so that it could become the living instrument for the creation of one Arab nation with an eternal mission.54 The Arab nation was in such dire straits that the need for rejuvenation was immediate, and could not be left to a gradual, evolutionary transformation.

Indeed, unlike the Bath, which at various times in the 1960s broke with Nasir, attacking him and his policies vehemently, and advocating a different Arab nationalist path, the ANM remained on the whole loyal to Nasir and his brand of Arab nationalism right until the disastrous Arab defeat in the June 1967 Six Day War.62 It was as though the ANM saw itself as an arm of Nasirist policies, working at the grassroots level, spreading Arab nationalist doctrine, partic­ularly in Palestine, Iraq, the Gulf, and South Arabia.63 Undoubt­edly, this close, almost symbiotic, association with Nasir was bene­.cial to the ANM; Nasirs triumphs were theirs, and his charisma bene.ted their organization. But this association also had its costs. Nasirs defeats re.ected badly on the ANM. It is hardly coinciden­tal that the organization began to atrophy in the mid-1960s when Nasirs Egypt suffered a number of setbacks in the Arab world. Indeed, the ANM disintegrated as a uni.ed movement in the wake of the Six Day War. Moreover, its close association with Nasir robbed it of a separate identity. What need was there for someone who already identi.ed himself as a Nasirist or Arab nationalist to join the ANM? Perhaps this is why the ANM never achieved the later political prominence of the Bath, which had always been jeal­ous about preserving its own separate political identity. On bal­ance, however, the association with Nasir was ultimately bene.cial to the ANM.

While Egypts perceived victory in the Suez Crisis and the merger of Egypt and Syria into the UAR constituted perhaps the two singular events that truly galvanized Arab public opinion behind the ideas and symbols of Arab nationalism, it was the Baghdad Pact which was the de.ning event that triggered a chain of political initiatives and responses that ultimately were to mark the period as the nationalist era. It was in this era that large segments of the educated populace, bewitched by the power of the Arab idea and seduced by the cha­risma of Gamal Abd al-Nasir, came to believe passionately, albeit nai¨vely as it turned out, in the unquestionable and inevitable tri­umph of Arab nationalism. And indeed if nothing else, it was the Baghdad Pact that brought Egypt fully, unequivocally, and vigor­ously into the very heart of Arab politics.",

This appar­ently came as a great surprise to Nasir and the Egyptian leaders. Nasir had thought that he had extracted a promise from Nuri not to make a signi.cant move in the direction of an alliance with the West without .rst consulting with Cairo.8 In response, Nasir called a meeting of Arab prime ministers in Cairo with the intention of condemning the proposed Iraqi action. But the most that the prime ministers were able to agree on was to dispatch a delegation to Iraq to persuade Nuri to change course or, at a minimum, to postpone the pending treaty. The delegation included Colonel Salah Salem, a senior member of Egypts ruling group. Nuri would not budge, and his parting words to Salem were: I am not a soldier in Abd al-Nasirs army. Please tell him that I will not obey his orders.9 And indeed he did not. On February 25, 1955, Iraq signed a secu­rity treaty with Turkey, which became known as Mithaq Baghdad, the Baghdad Pact. The treaty was designed to be the .rst step of a regional security alliance involving Pakistan and Iran and the possi­ble future membership of the United States and Great Britain. Nuri immediately invited other Arab countries to join. p. 117.

The truth is far more complex. Nuris family traced its ancestry and residence in Baghdad back to over three centuries to an Arab patriarch who married a Turkish woman from Constantinople.

The movements .rst major meeting took place in the Indonesian city of Bandung in April 1955. In this conference, Nasir joined some of the most prominent Third World leaders of the time, including Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Nehru of India, Premier Chou En-Lai of China, and President Sukarno of Indonesia, all of whom endeavored to stake out for their countries a neutralist position between the two seemingly irreconcilable posi­tions of East and West in those highly combustible Cold War years of the 1950s. As an international event, the meeting in Bandung attracted intense world scrutiny. Bandung con.rmed in the minds of Arabs Nasirs contention that Arab leaders can pursue policies that are independent of the West. Even more relevant to our topic, Nasirs words were treated by the other leaders as well as the media as representing not just Egypt, but the Arab world. When he spoke, he spoke with the con.dence and demeanor of someone who knew that he had the Arab populations behind him. He was becoming increasingly comfortable with his new role as the leader of Arab nationalism, and the main propagator of its message which pre­scribed the independence of the Arabs from all foreign interests and ideologies.",

Admittedly, this was not the .rst arms deal with a Soviet bloc country signed by an Arab state. Syria had already received a few arms from the Soviet bloc, which had created some concern in Western capitals. But the announcement of the Czech arms deal involving the most powerful Arab country, signed by a man increasingly perceived as the charismatic leader of the Arab nationalist march, was bound to create severe consterna­tion bordering on panic among the Western powers and their allies in the area.",

It was not just pro-Western Arab leaders who were be­coming wary of Nasirs mounting popularity among their popula­tions. The Israelis also worried about the possible deleterious consequences of the rising tide of militant Arab nationalism under Nasirs leadership on their young country. There were already some in.ltrations into Israel from Egypt carried out by Palestinian and Egyptian commandos calling themselves the fedayyin (mar­tyrs). David Ben-Gurion, the father of the state of Israel, was espe­cially irked. He was convinced that the Israelis had to teach Nasir a lesson, perhaps even remove him from power. It is de.nitely possible to topple him, Ben-Gurion told his cabinet colleagues, and it is even a mitzvah [a sacred obligation] to do so. Who is he anyway, this Nasser-Shmasser?16 One way to undermine the popularity of the Egyptian president among the Arabs was to show him up as militarily impotent. This way he would be cut down to size from the leader of Arab nationalism to a mere Nasser-Shmas­ser. So on February 28, 1955, Israeli forces led by Ariel Sharon (later to be elected Israeli prime minister in February 2001) launched a massive raid on the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip, de­stroying its military headquarters, killing thirty-eight soldiers, and wounding thirty-one.",

As the country secularized, and the in­.uence of religious schools waned,34 more Shiite Iraqis participated in the body politic. Some worked within the system and rose to positions of political prominence, others joined the underground political opposition. During the 1940s and early 1950s, many of the Shiite youth gravitated away from the Arab nationalist groups and toward the Communist Party.35 One of the reasons for this was Shiite concern that Arab nationalism was essentially a Sunni project aimed at uniting the Arab states, whose populations were predominantly Sunni, thus rendering the Iraqi Shiites (a majority in Iraq) an insigni.cant minority. But if there was one period where this sectarian divide was at its lowest, it was during the 1950s, and particularly in this 19551958 period. It was not as though all Shiites became ardent nationalists, but more of them joined the nationalist ranks, be it as Nasirists, Qawmiyeen Arab (Arab na­tionalists), or Bathists. Indeed, of the seventeen members of Iraqs Bath Party leadership in the 1950s, eight were Shiites, including the secretary-general, Fuad al-Rikabi.36 More signi.cantly, as na­tionalists, especially in the mid-1950s, their identity was increas­ingly de.ned by their nationalism, so that their sectarian af.lia­tions became unimportant, not worth even inquiring about. Taleb Shabib, the .rst foreign minister in the Bathist government that took over power from Abd al-Karim Qasim in February 1963, says that members of the party command never discussed, indeed were unaware of, each others sectarian denominations.37",

The crisis could be traced back to the efforts by Nasir and his col­leagues to build the Aswan Dam, which since the .rst year of the Egyptian revolution had been the major development scheme planned by the new regime. The Dam had been constantly trum­peted as the symbol of a new dynamic and industrialized Egypt. As it was conceived, the Dam would extend continuous irrigation to Upper Egypt, enabling over 125 million acres of arid land to be cultivated. The Dam would also provide the necessary electric power to ful.ll the extensive industrialization program that Nasir hoped would give Egypt complete self-suf.ciency and help it catch up to the advanced and industrial West. In December 1955, the United States, Great Britain, and the World Bank offered to assist Egypt in building the Dam. This offer was accompanied, however, by several conditions, including World Bank supervision of Egypts budget and its balance of payments, as well as an Egyptian commit­ment not to seek aid from Communist sources. Nasir balked at such stipulations, which amounted, in his opinion, to foreign con­trol over Egypts economy and foreign policy. The United States and Britain, on the other hand, had decided at the time the offer was made that Nasirs response to the conditions attached to the offer would be an important factor in assessing future prospects for his cooperation with the West.38 As Nasir hesitated and demurred through the early months of 1956, Dulles and Britains prime min­ister, Anthony Eden, the Czech arms deal still fresh in their minds, decided that the Egyptian leader was surreptitiously negotiating a separate deal with the Soviet Union. Then two events occurred that were to .nally deal a deathblow to the Western offer of aid.",

Moreover, the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, had declared his willingness to join the West in an arms control regime in the Middle East. In case this were to happen, Egypt felt that recognition of China would give the Soviets the necessary camou.age to send arms to Egypt through a third channel, namely China.41 Dulles, however, had lit­tle time for such reasoning. He viewed Egypts recognition of China as further proof of Nasirs irreversible tilt toward the Communist world.

Eden responded by colluding with the French (upset over Egypts support for the Algerian revolution) and the Israelis (who sought an end to fedayyin raids into Israel). The purpose of this collusion was to reclaim Western sovereignty over the canal, defeat Egypt militarily, and thus undermine Nasirs pres­tige and leadership of the Arab nationalist movement. The tripar­tite attack began on October 29 with the Israeli invasion of Sinai, followed the next day by a prearranged Anglo-French ultimatum to both parties to stop .ghting within twelve hours and to with­draw their forces ten miles from either side of the Canal, so as to allow Anglo-French forces to move in between the two combat­ants. The ultimatum, which effectively called on the Egyptians to withdraw their forces over 100 miles, allowing the Israelis to ad­vance all the way to the Canal with no resistance, seemed to Nasir so fantastic that he initially believed it to be a bluff.45 But on Octo­ber 31, British and French aircraft began bombing Egyptian air­.elds. The objective was not just to restore Anglo-French owner­ship of the Suez Canal Company, but to topple Nasir. Immediately after the .rst bombing raid, a British radio station in Cyprus ap­pealed to Egyptians to rise against Nasir, who, according to the radio announcer, had gone mad and seized the Suez Canal . . . rejected a fair solution . . . exposed you to Israeli attacks . . . be­trayed Egypt . . . [and] adopted dictatorship.46 Within less than twenty-four hours, the attackers had succeeded in neutralizing Egypts air bases. On November 4, British and French paratroopers landed in Port Said on the Mediterranean end of the Canal, and two days later, after heavy .ghting and Egyptian casualties between 6501,000 dead, the town was in the hands of the invaders. Imme­diately, a British armored column began advancing down the Canal in the direction of Ismailia and Suez, the two other major Canal cities. At that point, the Egyptians became convinced that the Anglo-French forces were set on moving on Cairo. In an emergency meeting, Nasir and his colleagues decided to take poison rather than risk the national humiliation of capture by the invaders. But Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi, a senior member of the leadership was missing from the meeting, so an emissary was sent to .nd him and bring him to the meeting while another member of the leadership was dispatched to bring back the necessary poison. As Nasir and his colleagues waited for Bahgdadi to make an appearance and for the poison to be brought, news from New York, indicating British and French agreement to halt all hostilities, arrived in Cairo.47",

But in fact it was Washington that played the decisive role. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles had warned against the use of force, and were furious at not having been consulted by the British and the French; indeed, they felt that they had been deliberately deceived by Eden and the French prime minister, Guy Mollet. Moreover, they were concerned that the crisis in Suez would drag them into a possible nuclear con.ict with the Soviets. The British and French desperately needed American .­nancial help to offset the extra cost of alternative oil supplies after the Egyptians blocked the Suez Canal by sinking ships in it, and the Syrians blew up pipelines carrying British-owned petroleum from the oil .elds of Iraq to the Mediterranean port of Latakiya. The Americans, however, let it be known that any .nancial help was contingent on the cessation of hostilities. The immediate con­sequence was a run on sterling in international .nancial markets, and coupled with a chorus of global condemnation, even from close and long-standing allies, the British and French had little al­ternative but to halt the invasion. Away from public posturing, Nasir conceded Washingtons decisive role. In the .rst ministerial meeting after the collapse of the invasion, Nasir acknowledged the role of the United States and its president in foiling the tripartite conspiracy. He told the assembled ministers that it was Eisen­hower who played the greatest and most decisive role in standing up to Britain, France and Israel, even though the conspiracy took him by surprise in the middle of his election campaign for a second term, in which he was in need of Jewish votes.... But Eisenhower completely disregarded all this, and stood decisively and resolutely by Egypt.48 The lack of American support spelled the beginning of the end for the ill-fated Anglo-French operation, which was eventually to conclude in the ignominious evacuation of all their troops from Egypt by December 22, 1956, without the achieve­ment of any of their objectives.",

Understandably, Quwatly was incensed, accusing Riad of complicity, and repeatedly charac­terizing the action by Bizri and the other of.cers as a military coup. He told Riad pointedly that only the Syrian government had the authority to make a decision on unity.22 Syrias politicians could hardly be expected to get excited about a unity that would be bound not only to make Syria a satellite of Egypt, but also to push Syrias political leaders out onto the margins of political life in their own country.",

Some of Nasirs most senior colleagues emphasized the incompatibility of the two politi­cal systems.

Overall, the political and geostrategic obstacles seemed daunting.23 The eco­nomic conditions did not offer great hopes either. In Egypt, the currency was the pound, and the economy was shifting purpose­fully toward central planning, whereas in Syria, the currency was the lira, with an economy based primarily on freewheeling business practices and transactions.24 The Egyptians were thus worried that Syrias smaller economy would become a burden on Egypts trea­sury. And then there were those Egyptian leaders with Islamist tendencies, prime among them Kemal al-Din Husayn, who seemed to .nd the existence of Christians in leadership roles in Syria some­what unpalatable. When asked his opinion about unity with Syria by Nasir, Husayn replied: I do not trust them.... The Bathist leaders at present are agents. And Michel A.aq and Antun Saada are the biggest agents. And they are working against Islam.25 Per­haps the most telling advice came from Fathi Radwan, another member of Nasirs inner circle. Radwan cautioned his president: Tomorrow, you are going to become the President of the Syrian state, and you have not even put your foot in it, nor do you know much about it, nor have you given this step much thought.26 Nasir readily agreed, for he related to Radwan a conversation he had with Salah Bitar, the Bathist leader and Syrias foreign minister, who had joined the negotiations in Cairo on January 16 and who was trying to encourage Nasir to accept the Syrian proposals. Bitar told me, Nasir said, when a person prepares to dive into a swimming pool, he has an initial fear of the water, but this fear disappears once he has jumped into the water. So I told him, Brother Salah, what scares me is that I may be jumping into an empty pool.27 Given all these apprehensions and concerns, it is not clear whether the Syrian of.cers, who took off for Cairo on January 11, really understood what a tough sell they had on their hands.",

According to Britains Ambassador to Iraq, Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah believed that if the present trend of events, both inside Iraq and in the neighboring countries, continued without further check, the situa­tion would crumble irretrievably within a period of months and certainly before the end of the year. The impact of Nassers success and propaganda would prove too strong.45 Uzri too found the crown prince in a state of great fear and panic, telling Uzri that the UAR constituted a dangerous challenge to Iraq and a threat to its existence.46 Abd al-Ilah tried feverishly to induce the other members of the Baghdad Pact not to recognize the UAR on the grounds that the Egyptian-Syrian union was aimed not only against Iraqs interest, its security and its national goals, but also against its foreign policy, embodied in the countrys membership of the Baghdad Pact.47 But the crown prince was to be disappointed. Unpalatable as it might have been to the anti-nationalist forces, the UAR nevertheless had already been formed, was accorded enthusi­astic domestic support, and had received diplomatic recognition from countries such as the United States and Saudi Arabia. The Baghdad Pact countries therefore went ahead and recognized the UAR. As for Iraq, its recognition came only after the July 1958 revolution.",

In contrast to the popular euphoria that greeted the founding of the UAR, the Arab Union was met with universal silence and lassitude.51 And indeed, the Hashemites themselves knew only too well that they had long lost the popularity contest; a realization which only inten­si.ed their rage at the UAR. This was more than evident in the exchange of letters between Nasir and Iraqs crown prince, Abd al-Ilah, after the formation of the Arab Union. Even though the Hashemites had not recognized the UAR, Nasir dispatched a warm congratulatory letter immediately after the announcement of the Arab Union. Nasirs letter spoke of his con.dence that the Arab Union would add strength to the Arab nation and would be a shield against that nations enemies. Nasir also called the formation of the Arab Union a proud day for Arab nationalism.52 Abd al-Ilah, writ­ing on behalf of the young King Faysal responded by .rst thanking Nasir, then reiterating the alleged long series of struggles that the Hashemites had waged on behalf of Arab nationalism which was bound to lead the Arabs to comprehensive unity.

This tenu­ ous arrangement worked as long as the system did not come under any external strain. But the rise of Arab nationalism undermined the delicate balance, since the countrys politically dominant Chris­tian community saw in Arab nationalism and its ultimate goal of comprehensive Arab unity the dissolution of their separate identity and the loss of their political independence. It thus came as no surprise that the responses of the two communities to the an­nouncement of the UAR were radically different. In general, most Muslims rejoiced: many Muslim schools held celebratory rallies, and demonstrations in support of the new uni.ed state were held throughout Lebanon despite governmental bans. Delegation after delegation crossed over to Syria to congratulate its leaders on the historic decision. Most of the Christians, however, were simulta­neously and feverishly reiterating their faith in, and hopes for, the maintenance of Lebanons sovereignty.",

It was Malik who convinced Chamoun to go to the United Nations Security Council, citing UAR interference in Lebanons internal af­fairs. In his address to the Security Council, Malik alleged that the interference was conducted through a large supply of arms to anti-government forces, training of subversive elements in Syria, partici­pation of UAR nationals in the civil war, and employment of hostile press and radio campaigns against Lebanons government.55 As it turned out, United Nations observers who were sent to Lebanon vitiated Maliks claims of arms supply or personnel in.ltration from the UAR. But that was not necessarily Maliks goal. What he and Chamoun were really after could be discerned from the complaints conclusion, which characterized UAR activity as repre­senting a danger to international peace and security.56 These were the very words used in the Eisenhower Doctrine, and as Malik was careful to link UAR action to international Communism,57 his appeal was meant to speci.cally target the United States and its allies, particularly members of the Baghdad Pact.",

He is reported to have told Nasir not to bother with Qasim, por­traying his senior partner as Iraqs Neguib3 (the early .gurehead of Egypts revolution who was later ousted by Nasir). He even went so far as to tell Nasir that if Qasim were to object to unity with the UAR, then he, Aref, would kill him with one bullet. Taken aback, Nasir interrupted Aref, telling him: No, brother Abd al-Salam. Let us not have this kind of talk. He (Qasim) is your senior col­league, and things have to be done through dialogue and persua­sion.4 Back in Iraq, Aref blazed his way through the length and breadth of the land, making numerous speeches, in which he ex­tolled the virtue of Arab unity and the leadership of Nasir. The UAR president was undoubtedly his hero, which moved one foe to remark that in his speeches, Aref ignored the leader of the revolu­tion (Qasim) and praised Jamal Abd al-Nasir. Was Abd al-Nasir the leader of the revolution?5 Indeed, Qasim, who by then was being called by his own supporters, al-Zaim al-Awhad (the sole leader) was hardly enamored with his junior partner. He made a point of devaluing Arefs role in Iraqs revolution to foreign visi­tors.6 More concretely, Qasim began to quietly clip Arefs wings by undercutting his power base in the army, while Aref gallivanted around the country making speeches.7 By September, Qasim felt strong enough to dispatch Aref to Bonn. Aref, however, resisted his unceremonious exit, and for his pains was arrested on Novem­ber 4 on the charge of plotting against the security of the home­land.8 This date marks the .rst erosion in the hitherto seemingly all-conquering Arab nationalist movement.",

At one time, an actual Arab unity had been but a fantasy clung to by the coffee bar set of nationalist idealists and dreamers, yet, incredulously and some thought miraculously, this fantasy be­came a realizable hope with the creation of the UAR, especially after the demise of the Iraqi monarchy and the staunch anti-Nasi­rite, Nuri al-Said. And now these once euphoric qawmiyeen (na­tionalists) watched, aggrieved and dumbfounded, as the Arab na­tionalist march, seemingly so near to its ultimate goal of Arab unity, came against the roadblock of the Iraq.rst wataniya. This abrupt reversal of fortunes led to a sense of near despair that was echoed by Nasir himself when he described the developing events in Iraqas the end for Arab nationalism.18 That, of course, was too harsh an assessment. In retrospect, it was not the end of Arab na­tionalism; more precisely it was the point at which, after four years of continuous and sometimes spectacular ascent, Arab nationalism began its gradual descent. But the road was still long, and other potholes were still to be encountered in the downhill slide of Arab nationalism. The next serious erosion in the fortunes of Arab na­tionalism occurred some three years later with the secession of Syria from the UAR.",

For instance, Bathist ministers in the northern region (Syria) embarked on appointing mostly Bathist personnel in their respective ministries, a practice that led to widespread dissension among the large numbers of employees not af.liated with the party.

Some of Nasirs most ardent and loyal supporters were warning him of Sarajs excesses and sti.ing authoritarianism. Riad Taha, a prominent Lebanese journalist, and sometimes a Nasir con.dant, writes in his memoirs that as early as June 1959, he told Nasir that the UAR was no longer secure, since even those who had supported him were beginning to hold back. Taha point­edly told Nasir: when the Syrians gathered around you, they thought they would no longer live in a police state, yet they are living under Hamid al-Saraj. He then reminded the president that the Syrians had tasted democratic freedoms in the past, and grown accustomed to them.34 But to no avail. Nasirs successes thus far had been built not on political pluralism, but on an author­itarianism centered on one man; his own proclivity then was for a strong and centralizing authoritarian rule. In a later remark to an Iraqi delegation, Nasir dismissed the notion of the separation of powers, calling it a major deception, and declaring that in real­ity it simply could not exist.35 Added to all this was Nasirs convic­tion in the sheer anarchy of Syrian society and politics. Conse­quently, rather than heed the advise of his Syrian supporters, Nasir gave Saraj even more powers, essentially tying the future stability of Syria and the UAR to the savagery of Sarajs iron rule. Ex-President Shukri al-Quwatly, the man who in February 1958 had stood with Nasir basking in the adulation of the Syrian masses, later would remark that the Nasserite system relegated the major­ity of the (Syrian) population to the rank of traitors, governing by terror and trampling on the honor and dignity of citizens.36 Even the Egyptian journalist, Muhamed Hasaneen Haykal, Nasirs close friend and con.dant, when enumerating the reasons for the even­tual failure of the UAR, pointed the .nger at the excessively repres­sive police system created by Saraj. In Haykals words, the coercive machinery of Nasirs prote´ge´ and right-hand man in Syria had taken the form of a severe and destructive cancer.37 He could have added however that it was a cancer that his president and friend seemed content to live with.",

Kuwaiti celebrations were cut short abruptly when a few days after the announcement of the agreement, Qasim in a major speech not only withheld his recognition of the new state, but made it clear that he intended to return Kuwait to its former status under Otto­man rule as an integral part of Iraq.43 Adding insult to injury, Qasim appointed the ruler of the oil-rich sheikhdom mayor of Ku­wait, a position that carried a salary of about $500 a month! Dis­armed by Qasims announcement, the Kuwaiti ruler requested im­mediate British protection, and on July 1, British troops began to pour into Kuwait.

Intellectually, the Egyptian leaders, and indeed all those who be­lieved in Arab nationalism, had always separated the people from their rulers, believing fervently that if left to their own devices, the people would indubitably join the nationalist march. The popular response to Egypts Arab nationalist policies over the Baghdad Pact, the Suez Crisis, and the formation of the UAR, as well as the widespread and spontaneous pro-UAR demonstrations that erupted in Syria in the immediate wake of the secessionist coup, con.rmed this leadership-people divide in the minds of the Egyp­tian leaders. Nasir and his colleagues simply refused to accept that people whom they believed had been made by their reactionary leaders to live in thirteenth-century conditions would refuse to join the nationalist march and its modernizing ways.71 That the people of Yemen had not expressed a vociferous and public desire to do so was to the Egyptians no more than a function of the tyrannical rule under which they labored. While that view was perhaps true in the cities and among the swelling ranks of the literate middle classes, it was less true among the people of the countryside, and particularly among groups harboring strong tribal identity and liv­ ing in geographically isolated areas. While Arab nationalism had indeed made impressive inroads into traditional values and belief systems, it was pure wishful thinking to believe that in every corner of the Arab world, minds had been changed and centuries-old out­looks had been transformed. It was far too premature to pronounce the demise of traditional habits and ways, or to declare the victory of modernity; certainly not among the tribes in the northern moun­tains of Yemen. And by the time the Egyptian troops .nally with­drew in December 1967, the debilitating war had alienated many Egyptians from the ideal of Arab nationalism, cementing an isola­tionist impulse not to get mired in the quicksand of Arab politics. To Arab nationalists generally, the disappointment at the unsuc­cessful prosecution of the Yemeni war tarnished further the halo of invincibility that accompanied the Arab nationalist tide during its glory days between 1955 and 1958.",

And indeed, this new de.nition was enshrined in the re­solutions of the second Arab Summit in September 1964, which convened in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. As a signatory to the resolutions, Egypt pledged to respect the sovereignty of each of the Arab states and their existing regimes in accordance with their constitutions and laws, and to refrain from interfering in their internal affairs.94 To the incredulous Arab nationalist, sover­eignty had become the cornerstone of the new de.nition of Arab nationalism.",

Incensed by this public humiliation, yet cognizant of Israels glaring superiority, the Syri­ans requested Egypts military assistance, and lest the Egyptians vacillated, Cairo was reminded of its obligations to Syria under the terms of the recent defense pact. In this highly charged milieu, hemmed in by a military alliance that he signed more for its sym­bolic value than for its strategic utility, and limited by an increas­ingly frenzied public opinion demanding no less than the restora­tion of Arab rights in Palestine, Nasir made the fatal move in the middle of May of sending his army into the Sinai and closing the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. The Arabs went wild at this .rst real challenge to Israeli power and arrogance since 1948. The pressure on other Arab leaders to fall in line was immense. At the end of May, King Husayn arrived in Cairo to sign a defense pact with Egypt and place his forces under Egyptian command. The Iraqis joined the pact soon after, and dispatched an armored divi­sion to help on the Syrian front. Caught in the ensuing frenzy, the Saudis sent a brigade to join their Arab brethren at the front as well. It seemed that almost everyone believed in the inevitability of war and the certainty of defeating the illegitimate entity. At times it was almost surrealistic. For instance, in his farewell address to the mechanized division dispatched to the Syrian front, Iraqi Presi­dent Abd al-Rahman Aref asked his troops to behave properly and with decorum in their forthcoming occupation of Israel!103 Nasir, however, was far more of a realist.

Indeed, hopes were revived by the events immediately preceding the 1967 War, and who could tell what might have happened had Egypt and the Arabs, not Israel, won a famous victory. But Nasir lost, and lost infamously. And unlike the other setbacks, the scope of this defeat was such that even the most ardent utopian now discerned the permanent eclipse of Nasirs charisma. What was left was no more than a sense of cultural proximity, an intellectual recognition of common habits and custom, a belief that something called Ar­abism does indeed exist. Yes, they were Arabs, those people who lived in the various Arabic-speaking countries. Most of them agreed on that. But after 1967, hardly any of them believed in their eventual political unity.

And why ever not? Their Arab brethren had resources the Palestinians did not possess: large armies, wealth, and perhaps most crucially, sovereign territories from which they could wage the inevitable war of liberation. When the time came for the torch of the struggle to be lit, the Palestinians would undoubtedly participate in the deliv­ erance of their homeland, but only as a part of the combined Arab effort. After all, even the PLO was established by the Arab states in 1964, and given an army, the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), which was supposed, when the call came, to partake alongside other Arab armies in the liberation of Arab Palestine.",

One of the better known of these groups was al-Fatah, formed by a young, Cairo-educated engineer, Yasir Arafat.13 But until the June 1967 War, the Arabs continued to be the primary custodians of Palestinian aspirations, and the PLO of traditionalists and notables continued to receive the patronage of the Arab system and whatever legitimacy it be­stowed. Even an eloquent and committed advocate of Palestinian nationalism such as the historian Rashid Khalidi, who maintains that a Palestinian identity began to emerge as early as the late Ottoman era, accepts that in the 19551967 period, it was sub­merged by the pervasive force of Arab nationalism. Khalidi con­cedes that for many Palestinians during this period, Arab national­ism retained its appeal both as an idea that had long been popular among Palestinians . . . as well as what appeared to be a practical means to the achievement of their shared goal of the liberation of their country.14",

Hay­kal maintained that guerrilla tactics could not be decisive in Israel where the terrain was open, where the oppressors outnumbered the oppressed, and where in contrast to Vietnam or Algeria, the guerrillas could not seek immunity from enemy retaliation and at­tack because Israel possessed the capability to strike anywhere in the Arab world. This made the idea that defeating Israel through guerrilla warfare no more than a myth propagated by ill-informed romantics. The task of defeating Israel, concluded Haykal, could only be accomplished by the entire forces of the Arab world, of which the Palestinian Resistance would constitute an integral part.17 Even so, given his own emotional proclivities and the ac­knowledged popularity of the Palestinian Resistance in Egypt as well as in the rest of the Arab world, Nasir could hardly appear to be abandoning the Palestinian cause.

Nasir died suddenly right after the conclusion of the Cairo Summit in September 1970. His vice president, Anwar al-Sadat, succeeded him. Cavalierly dis­missed as Bikbashi aywah (Colonel Yes-man), and with no political base, Sadat could do little but promise to followfaithfully on the values and policies of his towering predecessor. In his efforts to legitimize his rule against potential rivals during the .rst year of his presidency, Sadat would often invoke the legacy of Nasir, pro­claiming his undying allegiance to that sacred memory and its prin­ciples.26 Indeed, at times he seemed to be more stridently Nasirist than Nasir had been. In a major speech to the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), the Nasir-created sole political organization in Egypt, Sadat not only reminded his audience that Egyptians belonged to the Arab nation both historically and by common destiny, but also promised that Egypt under his leadership would serve as the van­ guard of the Arab revolutionary march.27 These were words that Nasir himself had abandoned after the Khartoum Summit of 1967.

Once Sadat was able to root out potential rivals,28 he used the Nasirist political and administrative system to cement his own authority and political control. By 1972, Sadat had fully emerged from the overbearing shadowof his predecessor, and with that, Egypts ideological orientation became progressively more inward-looking, boasting an almost uncontested Egypt .rst orientation. Sadats earlier adherence to Arab unity became fully subordi­nated to the value of Egyptian patriotism, a concept which even though acted upon in the last years of Nasirs rule was, in fact, hardly publicized or publicly celebrated as an autonomous ideolog­ical category. As early as July 1972, less than two years after the death of Nasir, Sadat would make the forthcoming battle with Israel a function .rst and foremost not of Arab nationalism and unity, but of Egyptian patriotism and domestic unity.29 The eminent Egyptian political scientist, Ali Hillal Dessouki, in a study of Egypts foreign policy con.rms the clearly Egyptian watani ori­entation in Sadats foreign policy objectives in the 1970s. Ac­cording to Dessouki, these objectives were: the restoration, prefera­bly through negotiation, of Egyptian territories occupied by Israel since 1967; the termination of the war with Israel, as the economic cost had become unbearable; the improvement of relations with Washington, as the United States was the only country capable of in.uencing Israel; the rejuvenation and modernization of Egypts economy through the import of modern Western technology and private capital; and the modi.cation of Egypts global and re­gional policies in order to better pursue these objectives.30 Stun­ningly absent from these objectives, which were articulated and acted upon by Sadat until his assassination in 1981, was any refer­ence to Arab nationalism, Arab unity, or Arab revolution, terms that were almost the staple diet of Nasirist speeches. Egypt became Sadats single-minded concern, constituting the primary motivation for his two momentous decisions: the October 1973 War, and his trip to Jerusalem and the consequent peace treaty with Israel.",

The Sinai was the only concern of the Egyptian president. Sadat treated coordination with Syria as completely dependent on his conception of Egyptian interests, and indeed no sooner had coordination begun with the two countries launching their simultaneous offensive, than it ended.

The arrangement undoubtedly served Egypts interests, for it allowed Egypt to reopen the Canal, and to regain the oil .elds in Abu Rudeis.

The essence of Lebanons political system was derived from an understanding reached in 1943 among the countrys various religious sects in which political and administrative posts were dis­tributed in proportion to their numbers in the population.42 This potentially volatile confessional system worked as long as Leba­non was not subject to outside intrusions. But, the growing po­tency of Nasirist Arab nationalism began to strain the fragile com­munal ties inside Lebanon, which reached a breaking point with the radicalization of the Palestinian Resistance after June 1967. Palestinian military operations were launched from bases in the south of Lebanon, and after the guerrillas expulsion from Jordan in 19701971, the south of Lebanon became their only military / strategic haven. The majority of Lebanese Muslims felt that Leba­non was duty-bound to extend all possible support to the Palestin­ians, whereas most Christians resented what they perceived to be an inexcusable infringement of Lebanese sovereignty by the Pales­tinians. This attitudinal divide was reinforced by Israels an­nounced policy of instant and punitive retaliation against coun­tries harboring Palestinian guerrillas. Israels shelling of border villages and incursions into Lebanese territory became a regular occurrence, so that over the next fewyears, many villages in South Lebanon were gradually deserted by their inhabitants, most of whom took up residence on the outskirts of Lebanons capital, Beirut, in ghetto-type shantytowns. By 1975, the combination of Israeli attacks on Lebanon, the Palestinian-induced anarchy, and the extensive widespread demographic dislocations left Lebanon sitting on a powder keg waiting to explode. It came as no surprise therefore that a bloody and debilitating civil war would erupt and last for the next decade and a half.",

These themes were touched on by the Syrian president, Ha.z al-Asad, in a major speech delivered after Syrian armor moved into Lebanon.

Anti-Syrian demonstrations oc­curred in front of Syrian embassies in Arab and other foreign capi­tals. The rival Bathist regime in Baghdad bitterly attacked the fascist ruling clique in Damascus for this hideous crime against the Arab people of Palestine,49 and in a blaze of publicity dispatched troops to the Syrian-Iraqi border to execute their historic duty.50 By nature less shrill than their colleagues north of the border, mem­bers of the Saudi media re.ected their kings displeasure with what was happening in Lebanon.51 Egypt promptly withdrew its diplo­matic mission from Damascus and asked the Syrians to close their embassy in Cairo.

FewArabs in the 1980s and 1990s thought about Arab nationalism in the same way an earlier generation had done in the pre-1967 period. Whereas in those days Arab national­ism was synonymous with Arab political unity, now it had turned into a kind of universalist concept, a cultural Arabism with certain political overtones in the sense that it provided an umbrella under which sovereign territorial states were expected to conduct their business. In the 1980s and 1990s even this modest expectation proved too dif.cult to realize. One reason for this was the lack of popular pressure on leaders to conform to the strict norms of Arab nationalism.

After all, Syria was a sovereign state with a right to pursue its inter­ests and de.ne its international relations. Nationalist Libya, too, was hardly a paragon of support for the Iraqis. Depending on the mood of its mercurial leader, Muamer al-Qadha., Libyas political bearing continued to oscillate wildly between the two warring par­ties.

Iraq did receive money from the oil-rich Gulf states, but that was more to bolster Iraq as a security shield for themselves against the messianic vagaries of the Iranian ayatollahs than to any attach­ment to Arab nationalism. On the popular level, Iraq trumpeted the in.owof Arab volunteers into its armed forces to .ght the Persian common enemy. Most of these volunteers, however, were Egyptians and Sudanese who had arrived in Iraq in large num­bers in the 1970s seeking employment, and were drafted in the army by the Iraqi authorities. In reality, there were probably less real volunteers from Arab countries helping Arab Iraq in its war effort (which at times, particularly 19821983 and 1986 1987, was pretty desperate) than those who participated in non-Arab Afghanistans war against the Soviet Union.

First, the direc­tion of the new Arabism was bottom-up; it was not inspired by state institutions or by charismatic leadership, but by disaffected intellectual elites trying to chart a political course independently from the state. Second, the newArabism was nourished by a new regionally based media, which, because it was driven by pro.t, had to appeal to themes that were unifying in nature.66 Telhami sees this NewArabism as an independent transnational movement in the Arab world.67 But one is hard put to consider this new version of Arabist sentiment as analogous to the Arab nationalism of the 1950s and 1960s, moved as it was by the almost obsessive drive to organic Arab unity. To begin with, the disaffected Arab elites of the 1990s might have had differences with their govern­ments over a whole spectrum of issues, but not over the sovereignty of their respective states. And this was re.ected as well in the re­porting of the newmedia. Apart from the Palestinian cause, which by the way was supported not only by Arabs, but also by non-Arab Muslims and still many others, this media was as sensitive to state-centered concerns as to regionally based issues. Whatever this Arab transnational movement was supposed to do, it certainly could not challenge or even question the legitimacy and sovereignty of the Arab state.68",

After the SixDay War, Arab nationalisms slide toward poli­tical marginality became irreversible. And what stamped on it this sense of fatality was the fact that it was Egypt under Gamal Abd al-Nasir that lost. Egypts devastating defeat was Arab na­tionalisms mortal loss, for, as this book has made abundantly clear, the fate of Arab nationalism during the struggles, triumphs, and reversals of the 1950s and 1960s was inexorably linked to Egypt and its charismatic president. Had it just been Syria or Jor­dan, or even both, who lost the war, it would not have been the unmitigated disaster for Arab nationalism that the June war turned out to be. But Arab nationalism could not survive the ab­ject humiliation in.icted on its acknowledged prophet, who, through his shrill and overzealous propaganda machine, had promised a fabled triumph in this al-Maraka al-Masiriya, the bat­tle of destiny.

MaxWeber de.ned charisma as a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as though endowed with su­pernatural, superhuman or, at least, speci.cally exceptional quali­ties.2 It was these perceived qualities that allowed Nasir to assume the uncontested leadership of the Arab nationalist march, and that made him the only person capable of uniting the Arabs and de­feating their enemies. The charismatic halo began to fade after the collapse of the United Arab Republic (UAR),3 but it essentially evaporated with the June 1967 rout. The charismatic relationship between [Nasir] and the masses formed during the bright youthful days of Bandung and Suez, Fouad Ajami writes, was shattered with the defeat; another variant born out of despair and a sense of loss, sustained him until his death. He would stay in power not as a con.dent, vibrant hero, but as a tragic .gure, a symbol of better days, an indication of the will to resist.4 Ajami overstates Nasirs weakness, for the Egyptian president was still the most in.uential Arab leader. After all, at the height of the Jordanian civil war in September 1970, where did King Husayn, Arafat, and the other Arab leaders go but to Cairo and to Nasir to resolve the crisis?5 Yet, in.uential as he might have been, this Nasir was not the charis­matic leader that he was a decade earlier. To the .ock, he seemed no longer possessed of the superhuman qualities of old, and among the other Arab leaders, he was now at most .rst among equals. Even his most loyal followers and disciples, now freed from his charismatic hold, began to jump ship. Such was the course of action taken by the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), which, since the mid-1950s, had unquestioningly tied its fate to Nasir. After the 1967 debacle, the ANM publicly abandoned Nasirism which they now branded as a bourgeois movement which had been des­tined to fail and espoused instead Marxist-Leninist principles.6 The SixDay War was the culmination of a string of setbacks and reversals suffered by Nasir since Iraqs refusal to join the UAR. De­feat was no longer a word; it had become a culture, chipping away at the charisma of Nasir and the mystique of Arab nationalism.",

So imperial­ism, which for the Arabs subsumed colonialism under its de.ni­tional umbrella, became the much needed other for Arab nation­alism.7 The anti-imperialist crusade began with Egypts assault on the Baghdad Pact, and from there moved on to all imperialist inter­ests, projects, and alleged agents in the area. Imperialism was a convenient other. The imperialist forces were outsiders, alien to the area, had committed many injustices against the Arab peo­ple, and therefore were deserving of the abuse heaped upon them. And that in a nutshell de.ned much of the .ght against impe­ rialism. It was as much language as it was concrete policies.

They insisted that Arab nationalists had to understand that while various Arab states might accept an overarching Arab iden­tity, geographic and even cultural separation were real and potent enough to preclude an organic unity.

In the process of transferring the loyalty of the bedouin from tribe to state, successive Saudi monarchs made sure to act, and be per­ceived, simply as tribal overlords. An example of this endeavor was the Majlis, which was institutionalized in 1952 by a royal decree, granting every subject, in true tribal fashion, the right of access to the royal family. In these gatherings, the ruler was expected to settle disputes, take note of complaints, acknowledge proclamations of loyalty, listen to poetic renderings, or simply take part in general conversation. Such efforts to continue and maintain tribal identity allowed the Saudi rulers to withstand Nasirs Arab nationalist on­slaught for over a decade between 1957 and 1967. But the Saudis did not stop there. They also created a military force, the National Guard, which was independent of the regular armed forces, and which was entrusted with safeguarding the monarchy even if Nasir­ist elements succeeded in in.ltrating the regular armed forces. The novelty about the National Guard was that it was composed al­most exclusively of bedouins from tribes inhabiting the Nejd prov­ince of Saudi Arabia, from which the House of Saud originated.",

And then in the 1950s came the Arab nationalist offensive and its contemptu­ous belittling of tribalism as reactionary, unable to address the Arabs contemporary concerns. The nationalists employed a pow­erful argument in Iraq: The Arabs were once a great people, but then they embarked on a seemingly endless journey into oblivion, and when they .nally stirred from their deep slumber around the turn of the twentieth century, they arose into a world that was no longer theirs; a Western world; a world of technology, science, and cultural advancements associated with modern ways. To catch up with the West, the Arabs had to absorb Western ideas, to leave behind the old ways, turn the corner and take the route of moder­nity. And tribalism was decidedly not the stuff of modernity. Given the dominance and political power of this argument in the ideologi­cal and political discourse of the 1950s and 1960s, one would think that tribalism and tribal values would recede into downright irrele­ vance. Yet the eminent Iraqi sociologist Ali al-Wardi, writing about Iraq in the late 1960s, tells us that even in the cities modern­ization was super.cial, that in their essence many of the city folk were bedouin, and that the trappings of modernity, such as Western clothing, simply camou.aged deeply ingrained tribal values.26 As late as 1982, a leading member of Iraqs Bath Party would lament that, along with sectarianism, tribalism was tearing the unity of society to pieces.27 And indeed, in the wake of the Gulf War, in a concerted effort to shore up his waning support in Iraq, that erst­while Arab nationalist and lifelong member of the Bath Party, Sad­dam Husayn, would draw on this enduring reservoir of tribal val­ues, and elevate tribalism to the forefront of Iraqs political and ideological concerns.28",

Arab nationalism, until its .nal de­cline late in the twentieth century, continued to re.ect the tenets of German cultural nationalism. Arab nationalists would advocate the rejuvenation of the Arab nation, its political unity, its secular­ism, and its sovereignty. Yet, re.ecting the illiberal connotations of cultural nationalism, Arab nationalists would have little to say about personal liberty and freedom. Husri once said that the form of government was of no great interest to him . . . public attention should focus on the problem of unity: it [was] the national duty of every Arab to support the leader who is capable of achieving Arab unity.39 On the rare occasions when advocates of Arab national­ism spoke of personal liberty, they were quick to emphasize that the priority of the committed Arab nationalist cannot be his personal liberty, but his nations well being. In the words of Husri himself: patriotism and nationalism before and above all . . . even above and before freedom.40 As we have seen, this illiberal streak in Husris political ideas were aimed especially at those Arabic-speak­ ing people who did not share his views, and who might have been less than ablaze with exuberance at the prospect of being called Arabs. Husris response is uncompromising: under no circum­stances should we say: as long as [an Arab] does not wish to be an Arab, and as long as he is disdainful of his Arabism, then he is not an Arab. He is an Arab whether he wishes to be one or not. Whether ignorant, indifferent, undutiful, or disloyal, he is an Arab, but an Arab without feelings or consciousness, and perhaps even without conscience.41",

A number of pro-Western Arab countries had adopted parliamentary systems which were modeled on the British or French political systems. Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan had parliaments and legislative councils since the 1920s, and Syria and Lebanon immediately after they gained their independence in the wake of World War II. By the second half of the 1940s and early 1950s, all of these countries had experimented with various forms of multiparty politics. Admittedly, theirs were by no means true liberal democracies when judged by Western standards. There were, of course, cases of rigged elections, harassment of opposition parties, institution of emergency laws, and the like. But, when all was said and done, these systems still were far more open and far more civil than those subsequently instituted by the nationalist gen­eration. Take the case of the press in Egypt and in Iraq. In pre­revolutionary Egypt, Cairo boasted fourteen dailies and twenty-three weeklies, and Alexandria, Egypts second largest city, had fourteen dailies and seven weeklies. All were either privately owned or belonged to political parties, which made for a vibrant and free­wheeling press. In monarchical Iraq, one year before the 1958 mili­tary coup which toppled the monarchy and created a nationalist government, fourteen nongovernment newspapers were published in Baghdad, .ve in Mosul, and four in Basrah. While the govern­ment would occasionally ban a newspaper for a particularly viru­lent attack, the ban typically would last for a short period and the paper would duly reappear. After the Egyptian and Iraqi nationalist revolutions, the press came under strict government control, and in both countries a handful of state-owned dailies were published, distinguished from each other only by the title on the front page.",

For in­stance, one of the favorite slogans shouted by rioters and demon­strators in celebration of the demise of Iraqs monarchy in July 1958 was al-Qawmiya al-Arabiya tufny al-Ahzab al Gharbiya (Arab nationalism exterminates the Western political parties). It was not just that there was no need for different parties with differ­ent visions, since all Arabs supposedly adhered to one unifying vi­sion, namely, the nationalist creed. It was more pernicious: political parties would undermine the nationalist march; they would sow divisions in Arab ranks; they would become .fth columns for greedy outside powers. Nasir argued that these parties would not subordinate their own interests to the general good,51 particularly in the underdeveloped world, still suffering from social cleavages and foreign domination.52 Hence, if political parties were allowed in Egypt, Nasir charged, they would act merely as agents for the intelligence services of the various imperialist powers.53 Bathist writers and activists echoed this sentiment in their development of the Partys ideology and political orientations, both of which exhibited mounting disdain for a Western-inspired multiparty sys­tem. In a sense, the position of Nasir and the Bath was essentially a fusion of the existential element of anti-Westernism with the intel­lectual legacy of cultural nationalism. The result was the elimina­tion of multiparty systems, and their replacement with unitary po­litical institutions, whose function was purely to mobilize.",

That period of Euro­pean history saw the consolidation of states at the expense of smaller entities, so that between 1500 and 1900, the number of independent polities had shrunk by a factor of twenty!

They asked Egypt for a symbolic military contribution, which they felt would deliver the coup de grace to any remaining monarchist sentiment. It would also demonstrate to one and all Egypts cen­trality and unrivaled prestige in the Arab world, and could under­mine the stability of Saudi Arabia and the other pro-Western re­gimes of the Arabian Peninsula.61 Nasir dispatched a battalion, which was expected to make no more than a courtesy call. He then sat back awaiting the glory that came with his painless gesture. Five years later he would withdraw a huge Egyptian army from Yemen, which at its peak had amounted to almost half of Egypts armed forces.

Arab nationalism, in its heyday, bestowed many gifts on its children: independence from the outsider; pur­poseful strides onto the road to social and economic modernity; a sense of dignity after the long years of colonization; a set of words and phrases that allowed the Arabs to narrate their own history; an abiding belief in their own ability to sweep aside all doubters and naysayers who blocked the way to progress. For too long, the Arabs had languished under foreign control, suffering the sense of unremitting inferiority so typical of people who were not the mas­ters of their own house. And naturally, they looked for remedies to even the odds. Not until the Arab nationalist tide of the 1950s and 1960s would the Arabs acquire the con.dence in their own prow­ess to believe that they could stand up to the mighty colonizers. The Arabs had become accustomed to turning the other cheek, not out of generosity but out of submission and inferiority; now, during the nationalist decades, they could stand up, be counted, and slap back. In a sense it was this regeneration of Arab self-con.dence, this revitalization of the Arab spirit that was Arab nationalisms greatest gift and most enduring accomplishment.",

The result was that some states simply collapsed, others were so weakened that policies and services associated with state institutions no longer functioned, while still others tried to fight back with ever harsher methods that exhibited little or no regard for human decency, yet even so were unable to insulate the state and its institutions from its enemies.

In this popular and massive political eruption, the de­mand for instantaneous and drastic change was invoked through a number of lofty values and ideals. Yet the observer is hard put to find Arab nationalism among them.8 The demands of the colliding humanity in the city squares and streets of Tunis, Cairo, Damas­cus, Sanaa, and others, and the ideas and ideals that underpinned the peoples demands, were directed at a fundamental reform of the institutions, policies, and values of the state. People sought the restructuring of the states socio-economic institutions, insisting on the elimination of corruption and improving the condition of the under classes. They also insisted on the abolishment of ram­pant authoritarianism and the installation of true representative political institutions.9 Ironically and sadly, these demands, which should have strengthened the Arab state, in fact resulted inadver­tently and rather counterintuitively in what the Economist called the wretched condition of the contemporary Arab state. This oc­curred either because the revolution was hijacked by forces hardly enamored with the democratic idea and seemingly wholeheart­edly committed to violence, verging on savagery, or because the custodians of the state, with seemingly little regard for the lives, let alone the well-being, of their citizens, resorted to the coercive power of the state to make sure that their interests and privileges were protected and maintained.",

A spokesman of the organization told reporters that the al-Sisi government [was] acting as though to restore stability Egypt needed a dose of repression the likes of which it hasnt seen for decades, but its treatment [was] killing the patient.26 And if the Sisi government at first had manufactured phantom terrorists in order to justify its oppression, it soon would come face to face with real ones. Seeking revenge for what they considered to be the unlawful ouster of Morsi and the ensuing onslaught against the Muslim Brothers, radical Islamists took up the fight and began to carry out armed attacks against Egypts security forces in northern Sinai. By the summer of 2015, a wholesale insurgency was raging in the province, led by jihadists who had associated themselves alters-controversial-antiterror-bill.aspx with the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Armed clashes with police and army personnel led to the death of hundreds of security forc­es, and Sisi could not avoid acknowledging the growing threat, instituting in October 2014 a state of emergency in northern Si­nai. Still, by 2014 and after, the militant group had broadened its operations beyond Sinai, attacking not only security forces in a number of Egyptian cities, but also tourists and diplomatic venues. While by no means a broken country, by 2015 Egypt, once im­pregnable and immune to outside incendiary forces, had become yet another target of the jihadists relentless assault on the sover­eignty and legitimacy of the Arab state.",
